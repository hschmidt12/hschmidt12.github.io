In April 2023, I took part in the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://30daychartchallenge.org/), a community-driven event with the goal of creating unique and creative data visualizations. Every day presented a new topic, and I used R to create my charts around these topics. While I didn't complete as many days of the challenge as I would have liked, I'm happy to have had the excuse to try some new `ggplot2` visualizations. All corresponding code and individual charts can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hschmidt12/30DayChartChallenge-2023).
