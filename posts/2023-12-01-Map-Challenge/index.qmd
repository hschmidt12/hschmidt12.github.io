Every November, the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/){target="_blank"} brings together data viz enthusaists in an online challenge to create original maps using geospatial data. I first took part in 2022, and I was thrilled to make a new set of maps in 2023. All corresponding code and maps can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hschmidt12/30DayMapChallenge-2023){target="_blank"}.
