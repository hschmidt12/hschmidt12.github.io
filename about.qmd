<br>
I'm a psychology Ph.D. student in the [Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sites.temple.edu/sanlab/){target="_blank"} at Temple University, specializing in social neuroscience and quantitative methods. Under the guidance of Dr. Chelsea Helion, I study social and affective cognition by employing a multimodal analytic approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging tools with machine learning and computational methods. 

I have a bachelor of science in biology from Tufts University and a master of science in clinical neuroscience from University College London. 

Outside of the lab, I can be found reading books, traveling, drinking coffee, and spending time outside. I'm also a big data viz enthusiast - you can find some of my recent projects in my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd).
