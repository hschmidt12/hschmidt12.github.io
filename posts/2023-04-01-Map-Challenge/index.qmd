Every November, the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) encourages data visualization enthusiasts to create original maps using publicly-available geospatial data.
Every day presented a new theme, and I used R to create my maps around these themes.
This was a fun experience, and I was really proud of how much I learned about working with geospatial data in R by the end of the month.
All corresponding code and individual maps can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/hschmidt12/30DayMapChallenge-2022).
