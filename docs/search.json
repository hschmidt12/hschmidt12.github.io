Under the guidance of Dr. Chelsea Helion, I study social and affective cognition by employing a multimodal analytic approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging tools with machine learning and computational methods.\nI have a bachelor of science in biology from Tufts University and a master of science in clinical neuroscience from University College London.\nOutside of the lab, I can be found reading books, traveling, drinking coffee, and spending time outside. I’m also a big data viz enthusiast - you can find some of my recent projects in my portfolio."

By providing support to applicants, our goal is to make the psychology PhD application process more transparent and equitable for all aspiring psychological researchers. Applicants can find more information about participating in the program here. Those interested in volunteering as a statement editor can learn more about getting involved here."
