Hi, I'm Helen!

I'm a psychology Ph.D. candidate in the [Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://sites.temple.edu/sanlab/){style="text-decoration:none"} at Temple University, specializing in quantitative methods. I study social and affective cognition by employing a multimodal analytic approach that combines behavioral experimentation and neuroimaging with machine learning and computational modeling. My research is supported by an [NIH F31 fellowship](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/C795pE3Bw0q0iAW3MhQSsw/project-details/10899008){style="text-decoration:none"} from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

I have a bachelor of science in biology from Tufts University and a master of science in clinical neuroscience from University College London. 

Outside of the lab, I can be found reading books, traveling, drinking coffee, and spending time outside. I'm also a big data viz enthusiast - you can find some of my recent projects in my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd){style="text-decoration:none"}.
